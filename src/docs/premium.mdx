# Premium
Premium is a paid rank that helps fund the server and its development. Similarly to Patreon, subscribers pay 12.49 euro per month and get awesome perks as thanks for supporting the server. 

One of the many great benefits of premium is **queue priority** which lets subscribers save time by moving past everyone without premium in the queue. Premium also gives subscribers a **gold name** in chat, the ability to **change map claim color**, **longer render distance** and **exclusive early access to new servers and features**. 
Mystery crates and exclusive collectibles are other perks obtained with premium.

[Here is the store page](https://store.earthmc.net/category/premium) if you are interested in subscribing. Supported payment methods are **PayPal**, **Stripe**, and **Trustly**.
