# Premium
Premium is a paid rank that helps fund the server and its development. It works like Patreon if you're familiar with that. Subscribers pay $7.99 per month and get awesome perks as thanks for helping the server out. 

One of the many great benefits of premium is **queue priority** which lets subscribers save time by moving past everyone without premium in the queue. Premium also gives subscribers a **gold name** in chat, the ability to **change map claim color**, and **exclusive access to beta servers**.
Mystery crates and exclusive collectibles are other perks obtained with premium.

[Here is the store page](https://store.earthmc.net/category/premium) if you are interested in subscribing. Supported payment methods are **PayPal**, **Stripe**, and **Trustly**.
